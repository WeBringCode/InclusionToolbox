## The journey to a digitally inclusive society

Welcome to our documentation hub! This introduction is designed to give you an overview of our project and the tools we've developed, our ambitions and the philosophy behind our work. 

Our project is housed under the "Digital Inclusion Toolbox" initiative, aiming to foster a community-driven approach to digitally inclusive products and services.

### Background: Bridging the digital divide

Digital exclusion can impact anyone, negatively affecting access to everyday digital products and services. Our mission is to develop solutions that will lead to a more digitally inclusive society and at the same time reduce digital frustration. 

The main question driving our initiative is: "How do we ensure everyone can be a part of the journey towards a fully digital society?"

#### Identifying Challenges

There are several barriers which might lead to digital exclusion:


-   Disabilities: Such as visual impairments.
-   Language: Not everyone speaks the same language.
-   Service Access: Not everyone has a digital ID.
-   Hardware Access: Not everyone owns a computer or smartphone.
-   Skill Levels: Not everyone possesses the skills to utilize digital services.
-   Information Channels: Not everyone has access to the internet, social media or government communication channels.

### Our Solution: A Toolbox for Digital Inclusion 

So far, we've created two different technical solutions:

1. **User Feedback App:** A tool to anonymously measure a users experience in a digital product or services.
    - **Technologies:** React.js, Spring Boot (Java 17), PostgreSQL, JPA, Docker, Keycloak, Redis.
    - **Purpose:** An intuitive, user-friendly feedback module that can be easily integrated on a webpage.
2. **Support Modal:** A support modal with various help functions accompanied by a help button.
    - **Technologies:** Vue.js.
    - **Purpose:** A tool to provide users with a easily recognizable and unified way of seeking assistance.

### Governance and Future Development

-   **Governance Models:** 
    - Centralized hosting and management, with external entities implementing and utilizing it.
    - Independent hosting and management by each individual entity.
-   **Future Developments:** 
    - Further enhancements of the User Feedback App, to gather more information about a users issue when the feedback score is low. 
    - Add a backoffice/admin panel, to expand data visualization of user feedback (business intelligence). 
    - Futher expansion of the Support Modal, adding e.g. personalized user settings.
